## Overview

The `stabilityselectr` package performs stability selection with a
variety of kernels provided by the `glmnet` package, and provides simple
tools for plotting and extracting selected features. There is additional
functionality designed to facilitate various forms of permutation
clustering analyses.

## Package Notes

- The `stabilityselectr` package is easy to use.
- It is my first go-to when looking at dimensionality reduction and
  upstream feature selection.
